# tfpFill The Family Pack fill program

This is a personal project and is used with private files which are not being made available.
I've put it here for convenience only.

In researching my own family, I used to have a system based on the Generations EasyTree program.
This program was abandoned by its owners around the year 2000, but by this time I had built up
a system of programs (written by me) that would massage the html output files of EasyTree and
link them to my own (handwritten) html data files.
I also had also created programs that would produce html charts and index files.

The first use of this program was to transfer as much data as possible into The Family Pack
program for testing and program development. It was intended to be a "test many, run once"
program since once TFP and tfpFill are fully working, tfpFill would be redundant.

However, it has already had one useful run since I have now transferred the data
held in EasyTree to TFP.
So the 'conclusion' side of TFP is now holding live data and tfpFill is being used to transfer
the 'evidence' side from my collection of html data files.

The build system is designed to be incorporated with, and compiled with, the TPF build system.
